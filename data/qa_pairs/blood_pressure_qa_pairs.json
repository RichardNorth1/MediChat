        "question": "What is blood pressure?",
        "answer": "Blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of the arteries. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and consists of two values: systolic pressure (when the heart beats) and diastolic pressure (when the heart rests)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is normal blood pressure?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can blood pressure change throughout the day?",

      {
        "question": "How often should I check my blood pressure?",
        "answer": "If you have normal blood pressure, check it at least once a year. If you have hypertension or risk factors, monitor it more frequently as advised by your doctor."
