      },
      {
        "question": "How does menopause affect urinary incontinence?",
        "answer": "Menopause can contribute to urinary incontinence due to the decrease in estrogen levels, which affects the muscles and tissues of the urinary tract, making them less supportive."

        "question": "What lifestyle changes can help manage urinary incontinence?",
        "answer": "Lifestyle changes include maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding bladder irritants (like caffeine and alcohol), practicing bladder training, quitting smoking, and staying active."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is bladder training?",
        "answer": "Bladder training involves setting scheduled times to urinate, gradually increasing the intervals between bathroom visits to help retrain the bladder and reduce urgency."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I know if I need medical treatment for urinary incontinence?",
        "answer": "Seek medical attention if incontinence is affecting your quality of life, if you experience significant leakage, or if you have other symptoms like blood in urine or pelvic pain."

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the role of surgery in treating urinary incontinence?",
        "answer": "Surgery may be considered for severe cases of incontinence that do not respond to other treatments, including bladder sling surgery, artificial urinary sphincter implantation, or bladder neck suspension."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can incontinence pads or adult diapers help with urinary incontinence?",
        "answer": "Yes, incontinence pads or adult diapers can help manage urine leakage, but they do not treat the underlying cause. They are useful for managing symptoms and improving quality of life."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the relationship between urinary incontinence and overactive bladder?",
        "answer": "Overactive bladder is a condition characterized by frequent urination and urgency, which can lead to urinary incontinence if the bladder contracts involuntarily before the person can reach the bathroom."
