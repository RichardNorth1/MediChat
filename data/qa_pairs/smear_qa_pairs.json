        "question": "What is a smear test?",
        "answer": "A smear test, also known as a cervical screening test, is a procedure to detect abnormal cells in the cervix that could develop into cervical cancer."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is a smear test important?",

      {
        "question": "What happens during a smear test?",

      {
        "question": "Can I have a smear test during my period?",

        "question": "What do smear test results mean?",
        "answer": "Results can be normal, unclear, or abnormal. Normal means no changes were found. Unclear may require a repeat test. Abnormal means cell changes were detected and further tests may be needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if my smear test is abnormal?",
        "answer": "An abnormal result does not mean cancer. Further testing, such as a colposcopy or biopsy, may be needed."

      {
        "question": "What is HPV and how does it relate to smear tests?",
        "answer": "HPV (Human Papillomavirus) is a common virus that can cause cervical cell changes. Many smear tests now include HPV testing to identify high-risk strains."

        "answer": "Yes, and it is especially important to monitor cervical changes if you have high-risk HPV strains."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I have a smear test if I am pregnant?",
        "answer": "It is usually safe, but unless necessary, it is often postponed until after pregnancy."

      {
        "question": "Do I still need a smear test if I have had the HPV vaccine?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I have a smear test if I am a virgin?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if my smear test detects HPV?",
        "answer": "If high-risk HPV is found, further testing or more frequent screening may be required."

      {
        "question": "Is a smear test the same as a Pap smear?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do smear tests check for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?",
        "answer": "No, a smear test only checks for abnormal cervical cells and HPV. STI testing requires separate tests."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I have a smear test if I am on my period?",
        "answer": "It is best to avoid scheduling during your period, as heavy bleeding may affect results."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can an abnormal smear test mean I have cancer?",
